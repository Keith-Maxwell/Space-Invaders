# Space Invaders

This game was created with the objective of discovering **Pygame** and learning some more in depth OOP with python. I made it by following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-__8Xw9KTM) tutorial from Tech With Tim on YouTube. I initially made it in 3 hours and made changes and improvements later.

## Controls

W-A-S-D to move up/down/left/right

SPACE to shoot

## Compatibility

- Windows only when using the .exe file

Youâ€™ll need to have Pygame installed to run the code without using the .exe file.
You can do so by using `pip install pygame` in the command prompt
